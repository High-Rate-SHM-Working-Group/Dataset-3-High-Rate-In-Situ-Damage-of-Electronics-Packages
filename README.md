# High-Rate-In-situ-Damage-of-Electronics-Packages
Drop Tower shock tests of highly-instrumented electronics package

## Notes

This data set was developed at the AFRL to be shared with academic collaborators to provide relevant high-rate in-situ data on a highly instrumented electronic assembly under high-level mechanical shock for the development of real-time damage detection and remaining useful life (prognosis) algorithms on electronic systems. The PDF titled "High Rate In-Situ Damage_20200429_96TW-2020-0119.pdf" contains a more detailed discussion of the dataset.
